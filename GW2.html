          Garden Warfare 2 is the best game of the<br>
          Plants Vs Zombies franchise. It is an FPS<br>
          in wich you play as either the plants or the zombies.<br>
          Imagine Call Of Duty but where you actually enjoy<br>
          the game and have fun. There isn't only online,<br>
          it also has a very interesting solo adventure where<br>
          you try to find hidden gnomes all around your base.<br>
          Every charchter has different variants (they removed<br>
          them in BFN even if no one asked for it) wich is the<br>
          collest part of the game, like who doesn't want<br>
          to be a fire shooting pea or a midget zombie<br>
          controlling a massive robot with lazers.<br>
